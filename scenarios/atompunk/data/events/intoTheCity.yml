    <p>You come across a tall, sturdy wall, with an equally formidable gate. 
    As you come closer, Marlon pipes up, and makes his way to the front.</p>
    <p>"Hey, what's up! It's me!" he exclaims, loudly, as though the wall could
    respond. An awkward moment fills the void.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a loud PA breaks the silence.</p>
    <p>"Hey! Marlon! Welcome back! I see you've made some friends!" We catch a peek of
    him blushing, before the squeaking of the opening door draws our eyes from him.</p>
    <p>"Told ya guys I'd help." he tells us meekly.</p>

    "Well...she and I are kind of close. But she can definitely be embarrasing sometimes." He chuckles.
    "Oh, and another thing; I have citizenship here, but you guys are totally new, so you'll probably have
    to deal with a vetting process of sorts, if you guys want in."
    The door opens up, and we make our way in. We have time to ask another question, if we want to.
