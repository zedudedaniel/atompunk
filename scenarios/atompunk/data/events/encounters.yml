    Who'd have thought that the so called dreaded pirates would help us? Just as some mutant
    creature arose from the depths, a passing pirate ship jumped in to rescue us. Before we
    even knew what was happening, they had defeated the beast. Instead of asking
    for payment, they just gave us a few tips of their hats, and were on there way.
