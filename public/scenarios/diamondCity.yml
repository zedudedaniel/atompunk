    Assuming that the city would be completely destroyed was a mistake. Not only did many buildings remain stable, the roads leading to it were relatively well-off, too.
    The first person we came across was a young man, dressed in tattered clothes. This mimicked his camp, which was similarly in squalor. Upon spotting us, he quickly retreated, panicked. He held a crowbar in his hand.
    "Who-Who the hell are you?"

    "I...I'm Marlon." he says, caution waning. He acts as though he expected an assault or mugging.

    He pauses. "I don't suppose you have any food? There's nothing here for me..."

    A quick shot was enough to finish the frail man, his tattered body falling to the ground. After a quick examination of his body and his tent, some rewards are found.
    His crowbar remains up for grabs; But it's not a weightless object.
