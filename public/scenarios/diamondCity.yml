    Assuming that the city would be completely destroyed was a mistake. Not only did many buildings remain stable, the roads leading to it were relatively well-off, too.
    The first person we came across was a young man, dressed in tattered clothes. This mimicked his camp, which was similarly in squalor. Upon spotting us, he quickly retreated, panicked. He held a crowbar in his hand.
    "Who-Who the hell are you?"

    A quick shot was enough to finish the frail man, his tattered body falling to the ground. After a quick examination of his body and his tent, some rewards are found.

  goto: exit
